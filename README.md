# Lab 5: Network Project

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation designed to demonstrate networking concepts including device configuration, routing, and connectivity testing. The topology consists of multiple routers, switches, and end devices configured to simulate a real-world network scenario.
